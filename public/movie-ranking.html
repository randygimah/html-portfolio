<h1>TOP 5 MOVIES</h1>
<h2>Is it even a good movie if Denzel is not in it?</h2>
<hr />

<p>Almost every other month or year (time flies too quickly!), in the middle of a small talk, whether it is with a work colleague or on a date(maybe lol), I get asked what my top 5 movies of all time are.</p>
<p>It is honestly one of the most difficuly questions. Kind of asking your uncle who their top 5 favourite cousins are (Unc, if you are reading this, I hope I am numero uno). The truth is I always give different people different top 5s as this changes quite often.</p>
<p>This page will contain my current top 5 which may change in the next hour or so.</p>

<h3>1) The American Gangster</h3>
<h4>This is a $25,000 dollar Alpaca, you don't blot that shit!.....</h4>
<p>I mean what  more can I say, Denzel killed this, that literally it.</p>

<h3>2) The Green Mile</h3>
<h4>I'm tired boss....</h4>
<p>Made me cry the first time I watched it and it didnt help that I watched it 4am</p>

<h3>3) Love Jones</h3>
<h4>I just want to come upstairs and talk.....</h4>
<p>Definition of black love</p>

<h3>4) Manchester by the Sea</h3>
<p>Too sad but worth it</p>

<h3>5) Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>And at the end, we all win!</p>
